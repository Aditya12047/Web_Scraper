# Web_Scraper
Web scraping code using Python with the help of the BeautifulSoup library.

Make sure you have the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries installed. You can install them using pip install requests beautifulsoup4.

In the code above, replace the url variable with the URL of the website you want to scrape. Then, modify the CSS selector in the soup.select() function to select the specific elements you want to scrape from the web page. Finally, extract the desired data from the elements using the appropriate methods and process it as needed.
